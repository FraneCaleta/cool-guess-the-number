## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FraneCaleta/guess-the-number.git
   cd guess-the-number
   ```

2. Start a local server (choose one of the following methods):

   **Python 3 (recommended):**
   ```bash
   # For Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

   **Or using PHP (if installed):**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

   **Or using Node.js with http-server (if installed):**
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

   > **Note:** Using a local server is necessary for the game to work properly due to browser security restrictions when loading local files.
